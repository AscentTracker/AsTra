AsTra
=====

AsTra = Ascent Tracker, an Arduino-based altitude data logger for (indoor)climbing

AsTra is a smallish (12x6x2.5 cm, 200 g) wearable device to record
altitude (based on barometric pressure) four times every second to an
SD card. For convenience also time, name of the climber and grade of
the route are selectable and stored with every ascent. The data are
processed with a Perl program to yield daily ascent curves (with
[dygraphs](http://dygraphs.com/)) for every climber.

The [demo graph for
Tarzan](http://www.helsinki.fi/~syrjanen/AsTra/Tarzan/2014-05-27.html)
displays each ascent as a curve, height versus time. You can select
which ascents are visible, zoom in with mouse etc.
